            Hey there! <br /> <br />
            I'm Gabriel and I'm an international student from Brazil at <u><a href="https://www.uwo.ca/">Western University</a></u>.
            I'm currently in my second year of Computer Science. <br /> <br />
            People tend to ask me Why left Brazil to study in Canada. Initially, when I first arrived here, my answer to that question was that
            I wanted to develop my english skills and get familiar with another culture other than my own. However, as time went by, my answer 
            changed. My time here in Canada led me to the realization of how important one's culture is for decision making in one's life. This is an unique concept to me, and I want to explore it
            more.<br /><br />
            After speding some time here in Canada, I decided to go into CS. Canada's "tech culture" was a huge factor in this decision. I never imagined
            such big events, like hackathons, that involved around coding to exist for students here.<br /><br />
            With all these factors, I could see how great doing University outside of Brazil would be. So, I made my decision to stay. I wanted to experience the best
            of the computer science world while also being able to apply that knowledge elsewhere, so  Western was my top choice University. By applying the knowledge I acquire
            participating in hackathons, developing projects and studying for my classes, I can go above and beyond what my academics can offer alone. I am able to strive
            for the utmost best of this field while simultaneously building connections and socializing. This is exactly what I want for my future and career. <br /><br />
            This year, I will have the pleasure of being a "year-long" orientation leader at Western. I will be a mentor for
            first years and help them go through their transition from Highschool to University the smoothest way possible. Being a mentor
            means more than just helping them with their problems. It also means being a refence for your major/field of study. This
            is also a reason why I chose to get into this position, as it will push me into developing myself both my technical and social skills even more.
            I truly believe that this will make me reach even farther within the CS world and strive for the best.<br /><br />
