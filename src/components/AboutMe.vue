            Hey there! <br /> <br />
            
            I'm Gabriel and I'm an international student from Brazil at <u><a href="https://www.uwo.ca/">Western University</a></u>.
            I'm currently in my third year of Computer Science. <br /> <br />
            
            When asked about why I left Brazil to study in Canada, my initial answer was that I wanted to 
            develop my english skills. However, as time went by, that answer changed. I realized how important one's own culture and the knowledge of other cultures is for decision making in one's life. 
            This was an unique concept to me, and I wanted to explore it more.<br /><br />
            
            After spending some time in Canada, I decided to go into CS. Canada's "tech culture" was a huge factor in this decision. I never imagined
            such big events, like Hackathons, that revolved around coding to exist for students here.<br /><br />
            
            With all these factors, I could see how great doing university outside of Brazil would be. Western was my top choice university, due to their commitment of providing a stellar
            student experience, in addition to the best of the Computer Science world.
            Utilizing the educational basis Western offers me, I am able to go beyond academics alone and explore different corners of CS through Hackathons, projects
            and internships. Thus, I am able to strive for the utmost best of this field while simultaneously building connections and being passionate about my future and career.<br /><br />
            
            During my second year at Western, I had the pleasure of being a "year-long" orientation leader. I was a mentor for
            first years and helped them go through their transition from highschool to university smoothly. Being a mentor
            meant more than just helping them with possible problems; it meant being a role model. This experience pushed me to learn more
            about myself, and learn different ways to deal with issues in a quick and efficient manner, by being present as both a mentor and a friend.<br /><br />
